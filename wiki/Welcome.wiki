= Introduction =
----
Plugin has been prepared in the PYTHON dev-language and works in the Enigma2 environment installed on the STB (Dreambox, VU+ etc.). This plugin does a query on Polish portal Filmweb.pl for information about movie or TV series selected in EPG and shows the info in a popup window on TV screen. When the query returns the ambigous results the list of possible choices is presented on TV screen so user can select correct movie and gets the information about it (rating, wallpaper, poster, description, title, original title, cast, plot, director, writer, release year). Using the plugin it's possible to login to the portal and enter your own rating for selected movie or TV series. 

The plugin is prepared based on the resources from the BlackGlass-HD skin (default skin for BlackHole image), so if you want to use it in the other skin you should copy proper resources to the proper location - you should look at skin definition in the sources.

= Installation =
----
  * SSH onto the dreambox
  * install libs: python-html, python-twisted-web, openssl, python-pyopenssl
  * copy IPK file to /tmp folder
  * use manual IPK package installation option from Dreambox plugin menu

= Usage =
----
You could run plugin from two places:
  * from Extension Manager - automatically searches the currently watched movie
  * using INFO button for a long time and than when the list of entries is showed selecting the movie position 
 
I've assigned function from Extension Manager on the YELLOW key button using Multiquick plugin.
